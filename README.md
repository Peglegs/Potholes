# Potholes

Mark: users entering pothole locations into database, pulling info from the DOT database and entering it into ours

Andreas: creating routes using google maps that avoid potholes, removing fixed potholes from database

Eric: allowing users to report potholes using a visual map (zooming, panning, etc.)

Whoever finishes first: CSS

Timeline: 
===
Week 1: Basic database entry, route plotting, map generation

Week 2: Incorporation of DOT data, route plotting with potholes, map generation of potholes

Week 3: Integration of entry form with map, pothole removal, map generation with routes, zooming, panning

Week 4: Debug everything (EVERYTHING), CSS stuff, turn it into an extension 

Week 1 Update:
  Andreas: routes can be plotted and displayed, checking routes against an array of potholes almost works but has a bug
  Eric: potholes can be placed, destination and starting points can be determined and are ready for the calcRoute, search box almost works with choosing locations, marker display works
